## User feedback

- Adam Hurst : The todo list application is very useful and easy to use. However, it would be helpful if you could add comments to the code to make it easier to understand and edit.
- Ugnius Mieldazys : In both of the solutions, the code has blue lines under some of the text.

## Improvements

As Adam Hurst suggested, I have added comments to the code to improve readability and ease of editing:

## Evaluation

Overall, I believe both of my solutions meet the requirements set by the brief. Throughout the planning and creation process, I made several key decisions that I believe were highly effective. Firstly, the libraries chosen for the indexing system were well-suited for the task. They facilitate reading and writing CSV files, and selecting WPF for the todo list application was an excellent choice because it enables a more styled and visually appealing GUI through XAML, compared to a console app.

The improvements made based on user feedback were valuable additions. Adding comments to the code has greatly enhanced its readability and ease of editing, as the comments clarify the purpose of different code sections.

In conclusion, I believe my two solutions effectively meet the brief's requirements and demonstrate excellent functionality, stability, performance, and usability. With the recent improvements, my code now also boasts superior readability, maintainability, and data management capabilities.

Usage, workflow, giving an easy time to use and quickly without destructive editting.
why did i use data binding, why md5 hashing,
 
what can i do to make their life easier.
what the client wants, need and what can be helped?
 
optimisatioon
methods i used talk about a hashing alg why i used it, why itd secure, negatives also
talk about if things have the same hash, it wont matter cuz its the same
 
why was we needing data binding, why it wont work too well
